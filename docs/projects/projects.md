## Ecosys Community Projects
TigerGraphs Ecosys is a collection of innovative projects, connectors, patterns, and tools developed by the community or with the community to help develop out TigerGraph's ecosystem. A project is marked with **`Community Support`** or if a project graduates into an oficial TigerGraph offering it will be marked with **`TigerGraph support`**.

    === "About"
        JavaScript connector for TigerGraph

        **!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!**

        This connector is intended to work both in browsers and on server side, to be Node.JS friendly (in the long term).

        pyTigerDash allows developers to harness the power TigerGraph with an equally powerful framework offering fully dynamic and responsive visualizations that can be deployed anywhere whilst staying in the data scientist language of choice, “Python”. Tiger-Dash toolkit will accelerate the process from data to value exponentially.

### TigerGraph.NET

???+ code-braces "More Info - Community Supported"

    === "About"
        TigerGraph.NET is a set of libraries, tools and components for building multi-target graph-powered applications using C# and F#. There are several sub-projects under the TG.NET umbrella:

        ### CLI
        The CLI project provides a cross-platform client for querying and monitoring TigerGraph servers including free-tier server instances. It talks to the REST++ and GSQL endpoints does not rely on the Java based GSQL client.

        ### Proxy
        The Proxy project is a proxy server for TigerGraph that provides common app services like caching and mitigates some of the limitations of using free-tier TigerGraph instances for browser-based apps. The proxy is a small .NET Core app that can run on most Linux environments like on a AWS micro-instance or as a container on Redhat OpenShift and provides a transparent proxy for REST++ and GSQL API requests from client-side code with the following features.

        * Authentication: You can set environment variables for your TG_TOKEN, TG_USER and TG_PASS credentials on the server so you don't have to expose these in your client app code.

        * CORS: The server supports CORS headers and CORS pre-flighting requests so you can make calls to your TigerGraph server API from your JS browser code. Normally you would have to configure the TigerGraph Nginx server using gadmin to enable this support but this isn't available for free-tier instances

        * Keep-alive: By default the proxy server pings the echo endpoint of the backing TG server every 15 minutes. By default free-tier instances shutdown after about 90 minutes of inactivity and there is no way of restarting them automatically.

        * Cachiing: The proxy server implements a simple memory-cache which caches graph data requests using the URL requests as cache keys. Apps that use graph data can avoid hitting the TG server on every request. More sophisticated caches and schemes can be implemented pretty easily using the ASP.NET Core libraries and middleware.
